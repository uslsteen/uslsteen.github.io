The paper solves the problem of analyzing the behavior of programs for RISC architectures based on binary execution traces. As part of the work, the profile generation algorithm was improved, and its subsequent visualization was supported using the KCachegrind application with an accuracy of up to linear sections of code. As a result of the work, accurate application execution profiles were obtained on the SPEC CPU 2017 performance benchmarks.
