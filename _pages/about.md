## About me
I am a second-year student of the Master's program at the Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology.
I recieved my bachelor's degree at MIPT, Faculty of Radio Engineering and Computer Technologies. After completing my second year,
I realized that the focus of my scientific interests was mainly concentrated on computer technologies. Thus, in my third year of bachelor's degree, I started internship at Huawei RRI, a laboratory of microprocessor optimization in 2021.

## My experience
During my time at RRI, I have been involved in various tasks, which has allowed me to better shape the area of ​​my professional and scientific interests.
In Huawei:

- The [first task](https://uslsteen.github.io//publications/2021-12-01-verif-optimizing-transl/) was devoted to the release of verification passes for binary optimizing translations for the RISC architecture.
- My [bachelor's thesis](https://uslsteen.github.io//publications/2023-04-05-profile-generation/) focused on the topic of generating an execution profile based on a binary execution trace of an application under the RISC architecture.
- A significant part of my work was devoted to the design of RISC architecture, tooling to simplify description and verification

There are based on three axes related to computer architecture design, CPU simulation, and compilers. At the moment (relevant for the 2024/2025 academic year), I am actively searching for potential research topics for a PhD thesis in the field of Computer Science. So I try to find time to study current scientific publications. My master's thesis is devoted to the development of a reference simulation model based for the RISC architecture specification. I guess this topic can be improved and supplemented in the future using formal verification technologies.

## My hobby
I prefer to devote my free time to music:
- Since 2023, I have been leading a large student group at MIPT - the community of musicians [mipt.live](https://vk.com/mipt_live). In the relatively short time of my leadership, my team and I managed to revive the community from the ashes, organizing musical (mainly rock bands) concerts for students and graduates of MIPT. In addition, a new rehearsal space at MIPT has been organized under my management.
- In addition, I am the signer and rhythm guitarist of the musical group [Yesterday's Pizza](https://band.link/HEs1j)
